## Previous videos/talks

* [2014 Future Programming Workshop](https://vimeo.com/97713439) (also in [alternate source](https://vimeo.com/97648370), for aggregrating view counts): **Note: At the time Lamdu was rough and didn't have evaluation.** Introduces the basic concept of Projectional editing and parts of Lamdu's approach for type errors.
* 2018 - [Scaling the REPL Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhP6LcbRTs). Focuses on the live programming aspects of Lamdu. A talk version was presented at the [LIVE 2018](https://futureofcoding.org/notes/live/2018) workshop.
* 2019 - [Steady Typing: A friendly UX for Static Types](https://youtu.be/viF1bVTOO6k). Presents Lamdu's approach for static types and compares to other common approaches. [A talk version targetted at Haskellers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUoyrKRx8GBLOFIc85gK_ZM4P1FyULLpWTJLv3Vddc8/edit#slide=id.p) was presented at a Tel-Aviv Haskell meetup.

## Future videos

### Projectional syntactical sugar

### How names work in Lamdu and localization

### Responsive auto-layout

Dependency: It would make sense to wait until Lamdu runs on a smart-phone or tablet. This will probably require a lot of changes in our underlying graphics and events libraries (GLFW and `graphics-drawingcombinators`).
