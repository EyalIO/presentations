# Friendly Static Types

This video is based on [a presentation given by Eyal in a Tel-Aviv Haskell meetup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR7jyq9qWjbF9nIxysT8U3p_osJYn9tP7-vKvczcVNCy-JPwt7zTrvEZuE-lq2WxJwcg07STAOkpvGq/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

It compares the pros and cons of dynamic typing like in Python to explicit static typing like in Java, then describes how type-inference like in Haskell combines benefits from both while adding new problems (misattributed and complicated type errors), and how Lamdu's approach, named "Friendly Static Typing" provides a novel new interface which combines all the benefits, at the cost of giving up free-form text editing of code.
