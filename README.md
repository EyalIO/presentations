## Help us!

Any help here will be very appreciated!

We focus mainly on coding and it's hard to get people to hear about Lamdu in all of the other noise, interesting conceps and other projects around the internet.

If someone wants to collaborate on academic research papers, you are more than welcome! We have several novel and very interesting things to write about!
